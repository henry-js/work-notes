### Process of a PDR

- When a PDR issue is identified, the operator fills in a PDR form, no data validation is present so info can be sparse.
- Once filled in, it's sent to the PDR distribution group. This is useful

## Action Items
<!-- You can add any follow up items here. If they require more detail, you can use `Create Task Note` to create each follow up item as a separate note. -->

- @AdamJones will write up a basic process flow for me to use.
- Follow Up Task 2
